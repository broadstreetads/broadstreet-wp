    <h3>Looking for an adserver?</h3>
    <p>
        Ask us about <a target="_blank" href="http://broadstreetads.com/ad-platform/adserving/">our landmark adserver</a>, 
        built for independent publishers.
        It fixes all those little quirks that the makers of OpenX and DFP
        forgot about. You know, like slowness and "why isn't my ad serving?" troubles. 
        Oh, and it's faster too.
